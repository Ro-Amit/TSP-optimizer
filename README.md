✈️ **TSP Route Optimizer**
-
An algorithmic flight route optimization system for solving the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** over global capital cities.


📖 **Overview**
-
The TSP Route Optimizer is a software system designed to compute efficient flight paths between multiple international capital cities.

The project addresses the **NP-hard Travelling Salesman Problem** by implementing and evaluating multiple algorithmic approaches, enabling systematic comparison between solution quality and computational efficiency.


🧠 **Algorithms Implemented**
-
The system includes several approaches to solving TSP, allowing controlled trade-offs between accuracy and performance depending on input size:

* **Greedy Algorithm** – Efficient heuristic for large-scale instances  
* **Clustering-Based Approach** – Reduces problem complexity by grouping geographically proximate cities  
* **2-Opt Optimization** – Local search technique for improving existing routes
