✈️ TSP Route Optimizer

A smart, algorithmic flight route planner that solves the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for global capital cities.

⸻

📖 Overview

The TSP Route Planner is a comprehensive software system designed to compute the most efficient flight path between multiple international capital cities.
At its core, the system tackles the NP-hard Travelling Salesman Problem by implementing and comparing multiple algorithmic strategies — from exact solutions to heuristic and optimization-based approximations — enabling both correctness analysis and performance benchmarking.

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

The project includes several approaches to solving TSP, allowing to trade accuracy for performance depending on input size:
	•	Clustering-Based Approach – Reduces problem size by grouping nearby cities
	•	2-Opt Optimization – Local search improvement applied to existing routes
  •	Greedy Algorithm – Fast heuristic for larger inputs
